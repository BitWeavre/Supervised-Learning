        "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers.

        "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

        "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
        " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

        "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
        "\n",
        "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",

        "\n",
        "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",

        "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

        "The results of the evaluation performed on our three candidate models indicate that Logistic Regression is the most appropriate for the task of identifying individuals that make more than $50,000. This determination is based on a couple of factors such as the metrics, prediction/training time, and the algorithm's suitability for the data. In terms of metrics, both the Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier performed best as they were both tied at the same F score of 0.7 on the testing data when 100% of the training data were used. However, in terms of prediction/training time, Logistic Regression outperformed Random Forest by up to a factor of 30. Logistic Regression had a prediction/training time of 0.01 seconds versus 0.30 seconds for the Random Forest Classifier. This is a significant time difference in terms of execution speed. \n",

        "Logistic regression is suitable in cases that involve qualitative responses even when there are more than two levels. Logistic regression is effective and easy to implement, interpret, and efficient to train. As such, feature scaling and hyperparameter tunning are not required. The data is split into two, the training set and the test set. The training set is used to train the model, after which the test set is then introduced for the first time. The predictions from Logistic regression are mapped to be between 0 and 1 through the logistic function, which means that predictions can be interpreted as class probabilities which is useful in many applications. Hence, its outputs have a nice probabilistic interpretation, and the algorithm can be regularized to avoid overfitting. The Logistic models can also be updated easily with new data using stochastic gradient descent, and can also be regularized by penalizing coefficients with a tunable penalty strength. It is used when the data is linearly separable, and it gives the measure of the importance of a predictor both in the positive or negative direction.\n",

Here, the model has included Age and Marital-Status (not discussed in question 6 above) as part of the top five strong predictors, while, income and occupation (included in question 6 discussion above) were not included here by the model.\n",
        "This selection made by the model is close (3 out of 5) to the features selected in Question 6 above based on human intuition. Hence the visualization based on the feature weights confirms most of the thought that went into that determination in Question 6. Here however, Age and Marital Status are indicated to be more relevant than income and occupation by the model. In a sense, this is understandable because Age can be used to infer a person's level of experience, education, and other factors that can deduce whether the income is up to $50,000 or more. Similarly, Marital Status can also be an indicator of whether the person has a combined income with the spouse, which is likely to exceed $50,000 given other factors.\n"

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
